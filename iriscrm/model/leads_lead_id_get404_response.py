The tokens are generated in the CRM by each user individually, and each user may create one or more tokens.  To generate a new API Token, open your user settings page by clicking on your username in the top-right corner, and clicking on the ** Settings ** link or you can use the <a href=\"https://www.mycoastalpay.com/settings\">link</a>.   # Using the API Authentication to the API is performed via `X-API-KEY` header. Requests not properly authenticated will return a `401` error code.  `curl -X GET \"https://www.mycoastalpay.com/api/v1/leads\" -H \"accept: application/json\" -H \"X-API-KEY: [YOURKEY]\"`  Note that all requests should be made over `SSL`. All request and response bodies, including errors, are encoded in JSON.  The API returns standard HTTP success or error status codes. In case of errors, additional information about what went wrong will be encoded in the response as JSON.  By default, you can make `500` requests per minute. Check the returned HTTP headers of any API request to see your current rate limit status.  Each GET \"List\" request will return 1,000 matching results.  A maximum of 500,000 results can be returned per minute using a pagination parameter in these requests. # Using the Subscription API API Subscriptions are used to send information about an event to a URL and trigger an API call. This is more efficient than doing scheduled API calls.  To create a subscription, use the API Settings page or send a request using the instructions in the Subscriptions section below.  All you need to know is the events you want to be subscribed for and the url to which the updates need to be sent.  To create subscriptions using our GUI open tab ** API Settings ** at ** https://www.mycoastalpay.com/settings **:  <img src='https://www.mycoastalpay.com/images/docs/new-subscription.png'/> # Authentication Authenticate your account by including your secret key in API requests. Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas, client-side code, and so forth. Authentication to the API is performed via `X-API-KEY` header. Requests not properly authenticated will return a `401` error code. # Errors Our API returns standard `HTTP` success or error status codes. For errors, we will also include extra information about what went wrong encoded in the response as `JSON`. # Limiting You can make `500` requests per minute. If you will reach a limit you will get a `429: Too Many Attempts.` response from the server. Check the returned `HTTP` headers of any API request to see your current rate limit status. Headers description: * `X-RateLimit-Limit` tells you the max number of requests you're allowed to make within this application's time period * `X-RateLimit-Remaining` tells you how many requests you have left within this current time period * `Retry-After` tells you how many seconds to wait until you try again. (you'll only get `Retry-After` if you've hit the limit).   # noqa: E501
